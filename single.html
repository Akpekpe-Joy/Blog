                            <h4>Ghanaian Man Building a Modern Ark, Warns the World Will End in December 2025</h4>
                            <p>In Kumasi, Ghana, a man who calls himself Ebo Noah has captured global attention with a bold and unusual mission: he is building a modern-day ark, claiming God instructed him to do so in preparation for the end of the world on December 25, 2025.</p>

                            <p>According to Ebo Noah, his mission is similar to the biblical story of Noah, who built an ark to survive a great flood. He believes humanity is heading toward an inevitable global catastrophe, and the ark will serve as a vessel of survival for both people and animals. He has stated that he intends to preserve “two of every species” inside, just as the Bible records.</p>

                            <p>The construction, taking place in Kumasi, has attracted curious onlookers and sparked heated conversations online and offline. Videos of the wooden ark in progress have gone viral on social media, with mixed reactions:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Some view him as a visionary following divine instructions.</li>
                                <li>Others dismiss his project as misguided, pointing out that in the Bible, God promised never to destroy the earth again with floods.</li>
                                <li>Many have responded with humor, asking whether the ark could actually float or hold people if disaster truly struck.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Despite the criticism and jokes, Ebo Noah remains steadfast in his conviction, insisting that he is fulfilling a divine command.</p>

                            <h4>Russian Scientist Injects Himself with 3.5-Million-Year-Old Immortality Bacteria</h4>
                            <p>In an experiment that sounds straight out of a sci-fi movie, Dr. Anatoli Brouchkov, a microbiologist from Moscow State University, injected himself with a 3.5-million-year-old bacterium he discovered in Siberian permafrost — claiming it could unlock the secrets to living longer, healthier, and maybe even “cheating death.”</p>
                            <p>Dr. Brouchkov isn’t waiting for labs or ethics boards to approve him. He believes this ancient bacterium, Bacillus F, can help humans resist aging and environmental stressors. Since his injection, he claims to feel more energetic and healthier than ever, sparking curiosity, skepticism, and memes across the globe.</p>
                            <p> Fans of extreme science called him a visionary pushing the boundaries of human longevity.<br>Skeptics warned that injecting unknown microbes could be life-threatening.</p>
                            <p>Social media users had a field day: “Russian scientist finds immortality…in dirt?” and “Move over, superheroes, we have Dr. Brouchkov!</p>

                            <h4>First Human Case of ‘Horrific’ Flesh-Eating Parasite Detected in the U.S.</h4>
                            <p>"Ever heard of a flesh-eating parasite making a comeback? Well, buckle up—because the New World screwworm has reappeared in the U.S.! A traveler arriving from El Salvador was diagnosed in Maryland on August 4, 2025. The last human case was decades ago, and now, public health officials are hitting rewind—reviving the old-school trick of releasing sterile male flies to wipe it out. Sounds straight out of sci-fi, but it's real, and the labs are working overtime. Good news: it’s treatable and not an outbreak… yet."</p>

                        <h4>Japan Just Leveled Up Birth Tech</h4>
                           <p>Japan basically said, ‘What if pregnancy didn’t need… well, pregnancy?’ Scientists just pulled off something straight out of sci-fi: they kept goat embryos alive in an artificial womb—a kind of high-tech biobag that mimics the umbilical cord, nutrients, and fluids. This could change the game for premature babies or people who can’t carry a pregnancy. Human trials? Still a decade away, but the future baby hospital might look more like a lab than a nursery.
                            Oh, and if that’s not enough—Japan also just gave the green light to make human embryos from stem cells. That means creating eggs and sperm in the lab—no donors required—and then fertilizing them. Huge for research, maybe huge for fertility someday. But yeah, the ethical debates are about to explode.</p>

                            <h4>The Man Who Refused to Die: The Strange Life of Ismail Azizi with Six Deaths, Six Resurrections</h4>
                        <p>Some people’s lives are filled with ordinary ups and downs—work, family, little victories, small setbacks. And then there are lives like Ismail Azizi’s—so unusual, so unbelievable, that you almost have to pause and ask yourself: could this really be true?</p>
                        <p>Ismail isn’t famous. He doesn’t live in a big city. He’s just a man from rural Tanzania. But what makes his story extraordinary is simple: he has been declared dead six different times—and each time, he’s come back.</p>
                        <p>It all started with a workplace accident. He was badly injured, rushed to doctors, and eventually declared dead. His body was taken to the morgue, placed among the lifeless. Hours later, he woke up, shivering in the freezing air of the morgue. Imagine the shock on the faces of those who thought they’d seen the last of him.</p>
                        <p>But that was only the beginning. Not long after, malaria struck him down. His body went still, his breathing undetectable, and once again, his family began preparing for his burial. Just as they were making peace with their loss, he stirred and came back.</p>
                        <p>Then there was the car crash—a terrifying collision with a fuel truck. This time the doctors were certain. They told his family he was gone for good, brain-dead beyond saving. And yet, against every expectation, he opened his eyes again.</p>
                        <p>It didn’t end there. A venomous snakebite left him lifeless once more. For three whole days, he lay in the morgue, cold and unmoving. On the third day, he began to breathe again.</p>
                        <p>Later, he fell into a pit latrine—a grim accident that left him suffocated and declared gone. Still, he found his way back to life.</p>
                        <p>And then came the darkest chapter. By this time, whispers had begun to spread in his community. People were unsettled. They couldn’t understand how a man could die and return again and again. Fear twisted into suspicion, and suspicion into hatred. Some called him cursed, others whispered that he was a witch. Eventually, that fear drove them to violence. One night, villagers set fire to his home with him inside. He suffocated in the smoke, and once again, he was carried to the morgue. But even then, he refused to stay gone. He woke up, alive yet again, as if death itself had no claim on him.</p>
